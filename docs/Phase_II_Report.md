## Phase II Report – Restaurant Reservation System

### 1. Introduction and Goals

The Restaurant Reservation System was developed to streamline the process of managing restaurant reservations, customer data, and table allocations. The motivation behind this project is to reduce manual scheduling errors, prevent double-booking, and improve restaurant efficiency through data-driven insights.

The main objectives of the system are:

* To provide a centralized database for restaurant, customer, and reservation management.
* To ensure referential integrity across all relational entities.
* To support analytical queries and visual reporting using SQL views.
* To enable future integration with web and mobile applications for real-time updates.

### 2. Relational Schema and SQL Code

This section defines the relational schema, constraints, and data relationships used in the database. The design ensures data normalization and consistency across multiple interconnected entities.

**Key Design Features:**

* **Foreign Keys** maintain relationships between entities such as `Reservation`, `Customer`, and `Restaurant`.
* **Primary Keys** uniquely identify records across all tables.
* **Constraints** (e.g., `CHECK`, `UNIQUE`, `ENUM`) guarantee data validity.

**SQL Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Restaurant (
    restaurant_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    opening_time TIME,
    closing_time TIME
);

CREATE TABLE Table_Info (
    table_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    restaurant_id INT NOT NULL,
    capacity INT NOT NULL CHECK (capacity > 0),
    table_number INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES Restaurant(restaurant_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE Customer (
    customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE Cuisine (
    cuisine_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    cuisine_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Restaurant_Cuisine (
    restaurant_id INT NOT NULL,
    cuisine_id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (restaurant_id, cuisine_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES Restaurant(restaurant_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (cuisine_id) REFERENCES Cuisine(cuisine_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE Reservation (
    reservation_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    restaurant_id INT NOT NULL,
    table_id INT NOT NULL,
    reservation_date DATE NOT NULL,
    start_time TIME NOT NULL,
    end_time TIME NOT NULL,
    num_people INT NOT NULL CHECK (num_people > 0),
    status ENUM('Booked', 'Completed', 'Cancelled') DEFAULT 'Booked',
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES Restaurant(restaurant_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (table_id) REFERENCES Table_Info(table_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

### 3. ER Diagram

The Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram provides a visual overview of all entities and their relationships. It ensures database normalization and depicts how tables interconnect.

**Entity Summaries:**

* **Restaurant:** Stores details about each restaurant, including operating hours.
* **Customer:** Contains personal and contact details for reservation tracking.
* **Reservation:** Manages booking details, connecting customers and restaurants.
* **Table_Info:** Represents tables with capacity and numbering.
* **Cuisine & Restaurant_Cuisine:** Define restaurant categories and their associations.

### 4. Views and Data Retrieval

This section presents ten SQL views created for the Restaurant Reservation System database. Each view is designed to simplify querying, improve maintainability, and provide quick access to key operational and analytical information. For each view, a description, SQL definition, and sample result are included.
